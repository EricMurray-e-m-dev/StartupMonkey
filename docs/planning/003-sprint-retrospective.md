# Sprint Retrospective

**Sprint:** 003
**Dates:** Oct 18 - Nov 10
**Completed Issues:** Dashboard Foundation, Execute Create Index Action, Real-Time Metrics Display

## What Went Well
- Dashboard is looking very solid working quite well so far
- Executor is creating an appropriate index from findings in the Metrics

## What Didn't Go Well
- Create Index issue took almost an entire week on it's own, keyhole surgery required to track data from start to finish
- Necessary steps because a lot of bugs and incorrect logic fixed but definitely a big delay.
- Lots of tests made redundant, integration tests broken need to update to reflect new service features

## What We'll Change Next Sprint
- Timebox some issues better
